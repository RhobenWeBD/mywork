In my Final Project, I have to compute a text program using NLP. NLP stands for Natural Language Processing and is a branch of linguistics that allows to build 
language like speech and text by software. The most important program that helps NLP is Microsoft Foundation Class, which is a C++ object oriented library that 
allows to run programs using Win32 and COM APIs. Finally, another essential part of this project is Microsoft ML.NET, which is an open-source and cross-platform machine 
learning framework that allows to build projects using C++ made by Microsoft for the .NET developer platform. By using those applications, I was able to run the project 
successfully and accomplish what I needed to do.
